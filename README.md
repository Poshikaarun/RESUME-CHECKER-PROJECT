# RESUME-CHECKER-PROJECT

This project is a **Resumeâ€“Job Description Analyzer** that leverages the OpenAI API to evaluate resumes against job descriptions. It allows users to upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) and job descriptions (PDF), extracts relevant details such as name, email, phone, skills, education, and experience, and then scores the resume out of 10 based on job fit. The tool also provides short HR-style feedback and saves the analysis results into an Excel file for easy review, making it a handy solution for recruiters and HR professionals.
